=====================

Coral is a web-based visual analysis tool for creating and characterizing cohorts.

Users can interactively create and refine cohorts, which can then be compared, characterized, and inspected down to the level of single items.
Coral visualizes the evolution of cohorts and also provides intuitive access to prevalence information.

Coral can be utilized to explore any type of cohort and sample set. Our focus, however, is on the analysis of genomic data from cancer patients.

ðŸš€ You can try Coral yourself at: https://coral.caleydoapp.org/
